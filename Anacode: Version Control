== CVS usage notes ==
* <code>ensembl-*</code> repositories are stored on <code>cvs.sanger.ac.uk</code> under <code>/cvsroot/ensembl</code>, but we do not have ssh access to this server and so have to use sftp. You can still do useful things like <code>chmod</code> on scripts, but the filenames seem to have <code>,v</code> appended to them, just use this in the command, e.g.:
<pre>
chmod 555 /cvsroot/ensembl/ensembl-otter/scripts/apache/nph-get_accession_types,v
</pre>
* Other repositories (e.g. for <code>PerlModules</code> and <code>humscripts</code>) are stored on <code>cvs.internal.sanger.ac.uk</code> under <code>/repos/cvs/anacode</code> and we do have ssh access to this machine.
* To get cvs to update new directories as well as files try <code>cvs update -d</code>
* To revert a file (i.e. trash all local changes) to the latest version from the repo try <code>cvs update -C <filename></code>, the locally modified file is saved to <code>.#<filename>.<version></code>
